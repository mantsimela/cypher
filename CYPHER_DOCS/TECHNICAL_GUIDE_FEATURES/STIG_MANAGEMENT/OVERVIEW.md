# STIG Management System - Complete Overview

## System Architecture

The STIG Management System is a comprehensive compliance management platform that automates Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) selection, assignment, and tracking for government and enterprise environments.

### Core Capabilities

#### 1. Automated STIG Selection Engine
- **Intelligent Asset Analysis**: Automatically analyzes asset metadata (OS, applications, services)
- **STIG Mapping Database**: Maintains comprehensive mapping of STIGs to system configurations
- **Priority-Based Assignment**: Assigns STIGs based on priority levels (OS-level = Priority 1, Application-level = Priority 2)
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence scores for STIG assignments based on asset metadata quality

#### 2. Collection Management System
- **Logical Grouping**: Organize assets into collections for compliance tracking
- **Bulk Operations**: Perform STIG assignments across entire collections
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor compliance status at collection and individual asset levels
- **Reporting**: Generate compliance reports for collections and individual systems

#### 3. Asset Integration Framework
- **Real-Time Asset Discovery**: Integrates with existing asset inventory systems
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Enhances asset data with compliance-relevant information
- **Dynamic Assignment**: Automatically assigns new STIGs when assets are updated
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Validates STIG assignments against asset capabilities

#### 4. Professional User Interface
- **STIG Manager Compatibility**: Familiar interface for existing STIG Manager users
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Collections, Assets, and Instructions tabs for organized workflow
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live status updates and progress indicators
- **Comprehensive Instructions**: Built-in user guide with troubleshooting support
