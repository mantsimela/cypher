# Zero Trust Compliance Assessment for RAS DASH

## Executive Summary

This document provides an analysis of the RAS DASH platform's current compliance with Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) principles and outlines the enhancements needed to achieve full compliance.

## Current Compliance Status

RAS DASH is currently **partially compliant** with Zero Trust principles but requires several enhancements to fully align with a comprehensive Zero Trust Architecture.

## Current Zero Trust Capabilities

✓ **Authentication Systems**: 
- Multiple authentication methods including password-based login, PIV/CAC card authentication
- Support for SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect integration
- Multi-factor authentication capabilities

✓ **Password Security**: 
- System checks if passwords have been found in data breaches
- Prompts users to change compromised passwords via modal dialog

✓ **Vulnerability Management**: 
- Comprehensive vulnerability assessment
- Detailed remediation tracking and workflows
- Risk-based prioritization

✓ **Policy Management**: 
- Robust policy workflow systems
- Automated policy enforcement
- Compliance tracking with NIST 800-53 framework

✓ **Access Control**: 
- Role-based access controls for different user types
- Basic permission groupings
- Access logging capabilities

## Required Enhancements for Full Zero Trust Compliance

### 1. Continuous Authentication & Authorization
- Implement continuous verification beyond initial login
- Add behavioral analytics to detect anomalous user activity
- Implement session timeouts and re-authentication for sensitive operations
- Add risk-based authentication decisions

### 2. Micro-Segmentation
- Implement network micro-segmentation at the application level
- Add API gateway with granular access controls for all backend services
- Create more isolated security boundaries between components
- Deploy service mesh for east-west traffic control

### 3. Least Privilege Enforcement
- Implement dynamic privilege adjustments based on risk
- Add more granular permissions beyond just roles (attribute-based access)
- Implement just-in-time access provisioning for elevated privileges
- Default deny for all access not explicitly granted

### 4. Enhanced Device Trust
- Add device posture checking before authentication
- Implement device fingerprinting for access decisions
- Add device-based conditional access policies
- Support for endpoint security validation

### 5. Comprehensive Logging & Monitoring
- Add real-time security event monitoring for access events
- Implement anomaly detection for access patterns
- Enable comprehensive audit trails with tamper-evident logging
- Create automated incident response workflows

### 6. API-Level Security
- Implement security at the API level for all services
- Add rate limiting and throttling for all endpoints
- Implement mutual TLS for service-to-service communication
- Deploy API gateway with security filtering capabilities

## Implementation Recommendations

For initial implementation, we recommend focusing on these high-priority items:

1. Enhance authentication with continuous verification and session management
2. Implement API-level security controls including mutual TLS
3. Deploy more granular access controls with attribute-based policies
4. Enhance logging and monitoring for real-time threat detection

## Conclusion

While RAS DASH has implemented several key Zero Trust capabilities, particularly around authentication and vulnerability management, significant enhancements are required to achieve full Zero Trust compliance. By implementing the recommendations in this document, the platform can move toward a more comprehensive Zero Trust security posture.
