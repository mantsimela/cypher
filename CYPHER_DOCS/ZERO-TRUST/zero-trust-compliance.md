# RAS-DASH: Zero Trust Implementation Guide for Government Environments

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the necessary architecture, controls, and configurations required to make the RAS-DASH platform compliant with Zero Trust principles as mandated by recent federal directives, including Executive Order 14028 and the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model. By implementing these recommendations, RAS-DASH can operate effectively in government environments where strict security controls are required while maintaining its core functionality as a vulnerability management platform.

## Introduction to Zero Trust for RAS-DASH

Zero Trust is a security model that assumes no user or system, whether inside or outside the network perimeter, should be trusted by default. The model operates on the principle of "never trust, always verify," requiring strict identity verification and least privilege access for every user, device, and network flow.

For RAS-DASH, implementing Zero Trust is particularly important due to:

1. The sensitive nature of vulnerability data processed by the platform
2. The elevated privileges required for scanning and remediation activities
3. The potential access to critical system information across the organization
4. Requirements set forth in federal mandates for security tools used in government environments

## Zero Trust Core Pillars

RAS-DASH's Zero Trust implementation must address these core pillars:

### 1. Identity
- Strong authentication mechanisms for all users and services
- Fine-grained authorization based on contextual factors
- Continuous validation of trust throughout user sessions

### 2. Devices
- Device verification and health attestation
- Endpoint security monitoring
- Conditional access based on device posture

### 3. Networks
- Micro-segmentation and least privilege network access
- Encrypted communications throughout
- Continuous monitoring of network flows

### 4. Applications
- Application security controls
- API security measures
- Runtime protection

### 5. Data
- Data classification and protection
- Encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Controlled access to sensitive information

### 6. Visibility and Analytics
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Behavior analytics
- Threat detection capabilities

## Architecture Modifications

To align RAS-DASH with Zero Trust principles, the following architectural changes are required:

### Current Architecture Limitations

The existing RAS-DASH architecture has several potential limitations from a Zero Trust perspective:

1. Traditional perimeter-based security assumptions
2. Limited integration with identity providers
3. Potential over-privileged service accounts
4. Legacy authentication mechanisms
5. Insufficient network segmentation between components
