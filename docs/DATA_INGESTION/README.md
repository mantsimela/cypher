# Data Ingestion System Documentation

## Overview

The RAS-DASH Data Ingestion System is a comprehensive enterprise-grade solution for importing data from external security and compliance platforms including Tenable vulnerability scanners and Xacta compliance management systems. The system provides robust batch processing, error handling, data quality monitoring, and hierarchical data relationship management.

## System Capabilities

### Core Ingestion Features
- **Multi-Source Data Processing**: Support for Tenable (assets, vulnerabilities) and Xacta (systems, controls, POAMs)
- **Batch Processing**: Comprehensive batch tracking with success/failure monitoring
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation, error logging, and quality metrics
- **Hierarchical Data Management**: Maintains complex relationships between systems, assets, vulnerabilities, controls, and POAMs
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Live monitoring of ingestion operations with detailed statistics

### Business Value
- **Automated Data Synchronization**: Eliminates manual data entry and reduces human error
- **Compliance Automation**: Streamlines regulatory reporting and audit preparation
- **Centralized Security View**: Unified dashboard for all security and compliance data
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive vulnerability and control tracking for risk assessment

## Architecture Components

The Data Ingestion System consists of five main architectural layers:

1. **[Database Schema](./DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)** - 15+ tables with hierarchical relationships
2. **[Drizzle Schemas](./DRIZZLE_SCHEMAS.md)** - TypeScript type-safe database definitions
3. **[Services & Controllers](./SERVICES_CONTROLLERS.md)** - Business logic and API endpoints
4. **[API Routes](./API_ROUTES.md)** - RESTful endpoints for ingestion operations
5. **[UI Components](./UI_COMPONENTS.md)** - Frontend interface for ingestion management

## Data Flow Architecture

```
External Systems → API Endpoints → Controllers → Services → Database
     ↓                ↓              ↓           ↓          ↓
  Tenable         /ingestion    DataIngestion  Ingestion   15+ Tables
  Xacta            Routes       Controller     Service     Hierarchical
```

## Implementation Guide

### For Developers
1. Review the [Database Schema](./DATABASE_SCHEMA.md) to understand data relationships
2. Study the [Drizzle Schemas](./DRIZZLE_SCHEMAS.md) for TypeScript integration
3. Implement using [Services & Controllers](./SERVICES_CONTROLLERS.md) patterns
4. Integrate via [API Routes](./API_ROUTES.md) specifications
5. Build frontend using [UI Components](./UI_COMPONENTS.md) guidelines

### For System Administrators
- Database tables are automatically created via Drizzle migrations
- API endpoints require authentication and proper permissions
- Batch processing supports concurrent operations with conflict resolution
- Monitor ingestion statistics and error logs for system health

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- Node.js with TypeScript support
- Express.js server framework
- React frontend with shadcn/ui components

### Installation Steps
1. Copy all database schemas to your shared/schema.ts file
2. Implement the services and controllers in your backend
3. Register API routes in your Express application
4. Integrate UI components into your React frontend
5. Configure authentication and permissions
