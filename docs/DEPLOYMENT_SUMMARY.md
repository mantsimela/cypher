2. **Backup**: Creates backup of any existing installation
3. **Download**: Downloads application from S3
4. **Dependencies**: Installs all required npm packages
5. **Environment**: Creates production environment files
6. **Build**: Builds the client application for production
7. **PM2 Setup**: Configures PM2 ecosystem for both API and client
8. **Services**: Starts both API and client services
9. **Firewall**: Configures firewall rules (if UFW available)
10. **Health Check**: Verifies both services are running

## Security Groups Required

Ensure your EC2 security group allows:
- **Port 3000** (Client) - Inbound TCP from 0.0.0.0/0
- **Port 3001** (API) - Inbound TCP from 0.0.0.0/0
- **Port 22** (SSH) - For management access

## Post-Deployment Access

Once deployed, you can access:
- **CYPHER Dashboard**: `http://your-ec2-public-ip:3000`
- **API Endpoints**: `http://your-ec2-public-ip:3001`
- **Health Check**: `http://your-ec2-public-ip:3001/health`

## Service Management Commands

```bash
# View service status
sudo pm2 status

# View logs
sudo pm2 logs

# Restart services
sudo pm2 restart all

# Stop services
sudo pm2 stop all

# Monitor services
sudo pm2 monit
```

## Log Locations
- **Deployment Log**: `/var/log/cypher-deployment.log`
- **API Logs**: `/var/log/cypher-api.log`
- **Client Logs**: `/var/log/cypher-client.log`
- **PM2 Logs**: `~/.pm2/logs/`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check deployment log**: `tail -f /var/log/cypher-deployment.log`
2. **Check PM2 status**: `sudo pm2 status`
3. **Check service logs**: `sudo pm2 logs`
4. **Verify ports**: `sudo netstat -tlnp | grep -E ':(3000|3001)'`
5. **Test database connection**: Use the connection details above

## Support Files Available

All deployment files are available in the S3 bucket:
- Download deployment guide: `aws s3 cp s3://cypher-deployment-20250806/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md .`
- Download deployment script: `aws s3 cp s3://cypher-deployment-20250806/deploy-cypher.sh .`

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Run the deployment script on your EC2 instance
2. **Test**: Verify both API and client are accessible
3. **Configure DNS**: Point your domain to the EC2 instance (optional)
4. **Setup SSL**: Configure SSL certificates for production use (optional)
5. **Monitor**: Set up monitoring and alerting for the services

## Backup Strategy

The deployment script automatically creates backups before deployment:
- Backup location: `/opt/cypher-dashboard-backup-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`
- To restore: `sudo cp -r /opt/cypher-dashboard-backup-* /opt/cypher-dashboard`

## Updates

To update the application:
1. Upload new files to the S3 bucket
2. Re-run the deployment script
3. The script will automatically backup the current version before updating
