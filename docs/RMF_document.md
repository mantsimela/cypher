ðŸŽ¯ **RMF (Risk Management Framework) Steps for System Onboarding**

RMF is NIST's **Risk Management Framework** used for cybersecurity and risk management. Here are all **6 RMF Steps** for onboarding a system in your vulnerability application:

## **ðŸ“‹ Complete RMF 6-Step Process:**

### **1. CATEGORIZE (RMF-1)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:** Determine system impact level and security categorization
**ðŸ“‹ Key Activities:**
- **System Boundary Definition** - Define what's included in the system
- **Information Types** - Identify data types processed/stored/transmitted
- **Impact Assessment** - Determine Low/Moderate/High impact levels for CIA triad
- **System Categorization** - Based on Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

**ðŸ“Š Required Deliverables:**
- System Security Categorization Report
- System Boundary Diagram
- Data Flow Diagrams
- Information Type Registry

### **2. SELECT (RMF-2)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:** Choose appropriate security controls based on system categorization
**ðŸ“‹ Key Activities:**
- **Baseline Controls Selection** - Choose from NIST SP 800-53 control families
- **Control Tailoring** - Add, remove, or modify controls based on risk assessment
- **Supplemental Controls** - Add organization-specific or enhanced controls
- **Control Allocation** - Assign controls to system components

**ðŸ“Š Required Deliverables:**
- Security Control Baseline
- Control Selection Documentation
- Tailoring Decisions Document
- Security Plan (Initial Draft)

### **3. IMPLEMENT (RMF-3)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:** Deploy and configure selected security controls
**ðŸ“‹ Key Activities:**
- **Control Implementation** - Configure technical, operational, and management controls
- **Documentation Creation** - Create procedures, policies, and implementation guides
- **Integration Testing** - Ensure controls work with system functionality
- **Evidence Collection** - Document control implementation proof

**ðŸ“Š Required Deliverables:**
- Implemented Security Controls
- Configuration Documentation
- Implementation Evidence
- Updated Security Plan

### **4. ASSESS (RMF-4)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:** Test and evaluate security control effectiveness
**ðŸ“‹ Key Activities:**
- **Security Control Assessment** - Test each implemented control
- **Vulnerability Scanning** - Automated security testing and scanning
- **Penetration Testing** - Manual security testing and validation
- **Documentation Review** - Verify policies and procedures compliance

**ðŸ“Š Required Deliverables:**
- Security Assessment Report (SAR)
- Plan of Actions & Milestones (POA&M)
- Risk Assessment Report
- Control Assessment Evidence Package

### **5. AUTHORIZE (RMF-5)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:** Make risk-based decision to operate the system
**ðŸ“‹ Key Activities:**
- **Risk Analysis** - Analyze residual risks and vulnerabilities
- **Risk Response Planning** - Develop risk mitigation strategies
- **Authorization Decision** - Authorizing Official (AO) approves/denies operation
- **ATO Issuance** - Authority to Operate (ATO) granted if approved

**ðŸ“Š Required Deliverables:**
- Authorization Decision Document
- Authority to Operate (ATO) Letter
- Risk Executive Summary
- Continuous Monitoring Strategy

### **6. MONITOR (RMF-6)**
**ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:** Continuously monitor security posture and maintain authorization
**ðŸ“‹ Key Activities:**
- **Continuous Monitoring** - Real-time security posture monitoring
- **Periodic Control Assessments** - Regular re-assessment of security controls
- **Configuration Management** - Track and approve system changes
- **Incident Response** - Handle security events and breaches

**ðŸ“Š Required Deliverables:**
- Continuous Monitoring Reports
- Updated Risk Assessments
- Security Status Dashboard Reports
- Configuration Change Documentation

## **ðŸ”— RMF Integration with Your Vulnerability Application:**

### **System Onboarding Data Model:**
```
System Registration:
â”œâ”€â”€ CATEGORIZE â†’ Impact Classification (Low/Mod/High)
â”œâ”€â”€ SELECT     â†’ Control Baseline Assignment  
â”œâ”€â”€ IMPLEMENT  â†’ Control Implementation Status
â”œâ”€â”€ ASSESS     â†’ Vulnerability Scan Results
â”œâ”€â”€ AUTHORIZE  â†’ ATO Status & Risk Acceptance
â””â”€â”€ MONITOR    â†’ Continuous Compliance Tracking
```

### **Critical Data Points to Capture:**
- **âœ… System Profile** - Name, owner, description, system boundary
- **âœ… Impact Levels** - CIA impact ratings (Low/Moderate/High)  
- **âœ… Control Matrix** - NIST 800-53 control implementation status
- **âœ… Assessment Results** - Control test results (Pass/Fail/NA)
- **âœ… Risk Metrics** - Quantitative risk scores and ratings
- **âœ… Authorization Status** - ATO dates, expiration, renewal schedule
- **âœ… POA&M Items** - Outstanding vulnerabilities and remediation plans

### **Compliance Framework Integration:**
- **NIST SP 800-53** - Security and Privacy Controls Catalog
- **NIST SP 800-37** - RMF Implementation Guide
- **FISMA** - Federal Information Security Management Act
- **FedRAMP** - Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
- **CNSSI-1253** - Security Categorization and Control Selection
